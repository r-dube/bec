Please do you have a moment? Am tied up in a meeting and there is something I need you to take care of.

We have pending invoice from our Vendor. I have asked them to email me a copy of the invoice. I will be highly appreciative if you can handle it before the close of banking transactions for today. I can't take calls now so an email will be fine.
