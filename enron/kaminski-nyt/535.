Rebecca, 

I write to express unease and uncertainty concerning Mr. Sud. As per our knowledge, he now leads a life of retirement, and his attempts to communicate with us have been somewhat unconventional, perhaps even impulsive. It's clear that cultural contexts can influence conduct, and the difference might explain his approach, however, having never met him myself, it becomes difficult to draw an informed perspective.

Despite this, it's important we don't cast aside the intelligence he has presented. His inputs appear to carry a weight of significance which I believe would be unwise to ignore or fail to address. 

Yours,
Vince Kaminski
