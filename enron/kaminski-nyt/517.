Subject: Enron's Participation in the Earth Day "Trash Bash"

I urge everyone emphatically to stand alongside their Enron colleagues at this event. This presents a favorable opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the development of our city, while also ensuring that Enron maintains its distinguished reputation, particularly if rival energy corporations exhibit substantial attendance.

Best, 

Vince
