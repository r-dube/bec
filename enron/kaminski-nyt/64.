Subject: Re: Your Recent Inquiry 

Dear Kristin,

I greatly appreciate you forwarding Richard's resume. 

In the spirit of our standard operating protocol, we plan to conduct a telephonic conversation with him. This preliminary step is designed to facilitate a basic assessment of the candidate's suitability for our work environment.

Following the phone interview, and upon isolating the most conducive team for a subsequent progress assessment, we will arrange an in-person, on-site interview with Richard. 

Kind regards,

Vince
