Subject: Status Update: Stanford Fund Transfer

Dear Krishna,

Might you be able to provide an update regarding our pending payment remittance to Stanford?

We could potentially pen a formal letter articulating our intent to make a contribution, which in turn could serve as the foundational document for initiating the payment process.

If feasible, could you please discuss this matter with Hill at your earliest convenience?

Yours sincerely, 

Vince
