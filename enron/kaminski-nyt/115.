Dear Mark,

Earlier today, I left a message for you pertaining to an exciting opportunity at The National Forum on Corporate Finance, hosted at Rice University. They expressed great interest in your expertise and contribution as a panel member at this prestigious conference. 

The esteemed Professor David Ikenberry from Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice is overseeing this event and he looks forward to the possibility of your participation. You can reach him directly at 713-348-5385. It would be greatly appreciated if you could get in touch with him at your earliest convenience and let him know whether your schedule allows for you to attend. 

Thank you in advance for considering this exceptional opportunity.

Kindest regards,

Vince
