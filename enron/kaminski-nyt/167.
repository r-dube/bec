Dear Grant,

In the spirit of moving forward with our scheduled lunch, I suggest conveniences would be best accommodated if we meet either Tuesday or Wednesday of the upcoming week.

In order to secure a finalized date, do not hesitate to reach me. You may contact me at your earliest convenience tomorrow morning, or this evening at my residence, by dialing (281) 367 5377.

Alternatively, should the proposed dates confound your schedule, we could explore the possible change to a breakfast meeting instead. 

Warm regards,
Vince
