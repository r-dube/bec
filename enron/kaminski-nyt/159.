Dear Colleague,

As we turn our attention towards orchestrating the upcoming Fall 2001 and Spring 2002 speaker series, I invite you to contribute to our planning process by submitting speak recommendations. We are particularly interested in individuals with significant influence or interesting perspectives in the Rice and Enron spectrums. 

Your timely response would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
