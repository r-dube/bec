Subject: Dinner Invitation for Wednesday 

Dear Giuseppe, 

This is to extend an invitation to a dinner that I've previously mentioned, scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this Wednesday. We would be delighted to have your esteemed company at Il Fornaio, specifically in the intimate confines of their Canaletto Room. 

In addition to you, we are also welcoming Eric to share in this evening's camaraderie. 

Looking forward to seeing you both,

Vince
