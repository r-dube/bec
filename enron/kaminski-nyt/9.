Dear Francesca,

Greetings from San Antonio. It was a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

I wanted to bring to your attention an insightful piece on Initial Public Offerings published in the Financial Times. Just in case it has yet to cross your radar, I believe it's a worthy read. 

Best regards,

Vince Kaminski
