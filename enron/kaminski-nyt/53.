Dear Anne,

Thank you for reaching out to discuss the ongoing situation regarding Gwen Koepke. Indeed, this is a matter that has been awaiting resolution for some time and it's just as well that I wanted to bring this to our discussion today.

Our inclination should be to upgrade Gwen to the managerial status, a change which could potentially come into effect from March 1. In doing so, her remuneration will reflect her elevated status, including her current base salary with an additional $10,000, a practice that aligns with our typical protocol when promoting an associate to a managerial position. We routinely undertake such promotions in the month of March, and Gwen should not bear the consequences for any lack of efficiency in our management, manifest in the prolonged delays by Maureen and myself.

Separating from this issue, an unrelated yet grave matter requires our attention. Gary Hickerson, who is the primary recipient of Maureen's services, expressed dissatisfaction with her contributions a few weeks ago. Regrettably, he's reluctant to continue funding Maureen's position. This implies that Maureen must either secure another sponsor within Enron or seek employment elsewhere. Given her assertive and occasionally confrontational demeanor, finding an internal sponsor may well prove difficult. In an act of generosity, Gary has offered to finance a considerably substantial severance package for Maureen from his own budget. I'd be interested to discuss this with you further when time allows.

Best regards,
Vince
