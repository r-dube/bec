Dear Dave, 

I appreciate your generous invitation, and it pleases me to confirm my attendance at the aforementioned dinner and subsequent Saturday gathering. 

Regrettably, I will be attending alone. My wife will remain in California until June to support our son who is anticipating his graduation from college this spring season. 

Rest assured, as agreed, I will broach the subject of NFCF with Mr. Andy Fastow promptly. 

Sincerely,
Vince.
