Dear Layla,

Just to touch base on a few salient points.

I am delighted to confirm that I'll be present at the reception with bells on.

Please accept my apologies as certain administrative tasks have currently found my presentation development lagging. I take responsibility for this delay.

Notwithstanding, I assure you that the requisite number of presentation copies will be ready by the day of the event, or potentially a day in advance. Drawing from prior experience, I arranged similar protocol during Power 2000 and Power 1999. Please note that our company's Copy Center produced these copies, causing no added expense to your end.

On a related note, my accomplished colleague, Tanya Tamarchenko, has been invaluable in aiding with a particular aspect of the presentation. Considering her tremendous contribution, it would be fitting for her to present part of the speech. It is of utmost importance to me that credit is appropriately given where it's due. To acknowledge her work, might I propose including her as an additional speaker?

Kind regards,

Vince
