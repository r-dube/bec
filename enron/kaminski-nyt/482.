Subject: RE: NYTimes.com Feature: Business Entities Embrace Evaluation Metrics, Inciting Legal Confrontations 

Dear David,

I propose that we track these unfolding events meticulously and modify our existing procedures with the intent to circumvent potential legal repercussions. It has come to my attention that tech-giant Microsoft is currently grappling with a staggering $5 billion lawsuit. This arises from allegations of corporate bias in their employee ranking system.

Best,
Vince
