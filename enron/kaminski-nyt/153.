Dear David,

It is with regret that I must communicate my inability to attend the forthcoming conference, as pre-existing commitments preclude my presence. 

Might it be within the realm of possibility for us to consider the contribution of a colleague from our esteemed London office, who could effectively assume the speaker's role in my stead?

Regards,

Vince
