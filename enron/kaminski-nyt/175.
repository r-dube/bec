Osman,

There is a certain fervency surrounding this individual who has proven to be more than a little challenging. The most appropriate course of action would likely be to convey our understanding of his necessity to make choices that align with his personal best interests, while also emphasizing that his current decision is considered as nothing short of final on our end.

Nevertheless, we harbor a certain degree of appreciation for the interest he's demonstrated towards Enron throughout this process.

Our endeavors to hire a statistician have unfortunately been met with repeated failure. Yet, we remain hopeful for a favorable outcome someday.

Best,
Vince
