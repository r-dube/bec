Subject: Re: Morning/Afternoon Inquiries

Dear John, 

I'm writing to provide you with Ken Lay's direct contact number: (713) 853-6773. However, taking the initial step via Mark Palmer could be both strategic and advantageous. A conversation around the book with him might facilitate subsequent dialogue, his approval potentially serving as a reliable endorsement. 

Mark can be reached at (713) 853-4738. I plan to briefly apprise him of this arrangement to ensure he is prepared for your call. 

Best Regards, 
Vince
