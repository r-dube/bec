Subject: Recommending an Exceptional Candidate for Placement in London

Dear Colleague,

I am writing to recommend an impressive candidate that I had the good fortune to meet in Houston several months ago. This individual possesses a remarkable blend of intellect and qualifications that makes him stand out. 

He expressed a keen interest in pursuing an opportunity in London. I am seeking your guidance in this regard - could you please advise who would be the ideal individual in London to whom I might forward his resume?

Best Regards,
Vince
