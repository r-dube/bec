Subject: An Evening Invitation 

Dear Mr. Kaminski, 

I hope this communication finds you well. I have desired to extend an invitation for an evening of dinner at my residence for a considerable span. However, given your engagements of late, a formal proposal of such has remained elusive.

At a time of your convenience, I would be privileged to host you. An opportune day at your behest would be gladly arranged on our part. It would offer me great pleasure for you to make the acquaintance of my wife and have an opportunity to meet our daughter.

Looking forward to your favorable response.

Kind Regards,
Sandeep Kohli.
