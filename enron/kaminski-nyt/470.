Dear Gregory,

In the midst of our discussion on Monday, two significant details seemed to have been inadvertently omitted. 

Firstly, the compelling case of Mr. Joe Carson. There is no doubt that his commanding presence struck an impressive chord. With an ever-increasing need for seasoned economists within Enron's ranks, Mr. Carson's extensive experience and recognition within the sector could be a valuable asset to us. His pragmatic approach, coupled with a likely promising sense of steadiness, could indeed be a marriage of benefits with his expected role here.

There lies the challenge, however â€” Mr. Carson's preference to operate out of New York. We have to carefully weigh this geographical element against the advantage of his skilled presence in close proximity to our desks.

Secondly, it's worth considering the potential benefits Mr. Tony Mends could offer Enron. During my personal interactions with Mr. Mends, I've found him to be a remarkably intelligent and efficient individual. As a friend, my judgment may be influenced by personal relations, but I think there's little denial of his problem-solving proficiency that our organization, which deals with mammoth volumes of information processing, could greatly benefit from. Many thanks for considering these points.

Yours,
Vincent
