Subject: Re: Enron Default Swaps

Dear Darrell,

Enclosed for review are two notes of a technical nature concerning Enron default swaps; I trust these writings will prove invaluable in your examination of the matter. I anticipate engaging with the associated articles over the forthcoming weekend and look forward with keen interest to discerning whether their explanations are to your satisfaction.

Apologies are in order for the sluggish pace at which we are preparing an array of technical documents for your assessment including model reviews. Irrespective of this delay, we harbor the hope that you might set aside a modicum of time for a detailed appraisal of our credit models linked with our London credit trading, as well as our Value at Risk and option pricing-related models.

In addition, may I politely request that you cross-verify your invoices? The records at my end suggest a lingering balance due from us to you.

Kindest Regards,

Vince
