Subject: Re: Final Inquiry Regarding Grade Submission

Dear Pam,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek clarity regarding the protocol for submitting the final student grades.

As informed, I had allocated April 30 as the deadline for my students to tender their respective reports. With the stipulated timeline, I am confident that I will be well-positioned to have compiled and finalized all the grades by May 4.

Could you kindly confirm if transmitting these grades via email would be acceptable for our academic records?

Thank you in advance for your guidance on this matter.

Regards,
Vince
