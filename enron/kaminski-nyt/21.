Dear Felix,

For your convenience, would you be so kind as to forward your group's term papers to me once more? Please ensure that each paper is delivered as a distinct file. 

Furthermore, it would be greatly appreciated if these files could be dispatched to both my personal AOL account and my work email. For your reference, my AOL account is vkaminski@aol.com. 

Should you encounter any difficulties or require an alternate method of communication, please feel free to reach out to me at my home phone number, 281 367 5377. 

Best regards,
Vince
