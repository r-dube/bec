Dear Dave,

I hope this message finds you well. It appears our mutual associate, Mark Koenig, was anticipating your call as of last Friday at noon, based on the voice mail he deposited on my recorder. 

I kindly request you confirm whether you were able to reach out to him. 

Thank you. 

Best, 
Vince
