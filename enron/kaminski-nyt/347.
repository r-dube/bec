Subject: Re: Regarding Tony Hamilton

Dear Chris,

We initially hired Mr. Hamilton as a reinforcement for our Global Markets department. However, considering the highly specialized character of his work, Mr. Jeff Shankman has made the apt decision to station Mr. Hamilton within the Research Group, with a clear line of communication established with Mr. Mike Roberts, the current leader of our weather group.

In light of Mr. Hamilton's work, which is predicted to cater exclusively and directly to our Global Markets endeavor, it seems most logical for his expenses to be charged to Global Markets. We will carry out necessary adjustments to ensure his contributions will be represented to their fullest across various sub-units within Global Markets.

Mr. Hamilton has been dedicating the recent weeks to his training in Houston, in preparation for his forthcoming role in London alongside Mr. Roberts. We are brimming with anticipation for the prospects this cooperative endeavor presents.

Kind regards,
Vince
