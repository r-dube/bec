Subject: Regarding: SPSS Request for Iris

Dear Vasant,

After due consideration, I've granted approval, albeit somewhat grudgingly, to Iris' request for an SPSS access. In reviewing the situation, it became evident that her work in London justifies the use of SPSS. Moving data between systems, in such a case, could potentially entail more effort than the cost associated with the use of SPSS.

That said, a proliferation of systems is an area of concern for me.

Best, 
Vince
