Subject: Required Delivery

Dear Anita,

I would appreciate it greatly if the book, along with reprints of my academic papers, could be dispatched posthaste to the given recipient via FedEx. Shirley, I believe, should be able to assist you in locating these materials.

In anticipation of your prompt action,

Vince
