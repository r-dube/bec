Subject: Vladimir Gorny

Dear Barbara,

I have taken the liberty in contacting Mr. Vladimir Gorny to inform him that Mr. Jorion's presentation is separate from the seminar facilitated by Enron. It has been clarified that the session is a confidential meeting dedicated exclusively to our esteemed faculty members. 

When conveying this message, I drew a comparison to Enron's hiring process, highlighting that Rice observers are unlikely to be included in their private recruitments. Mr. Gorny expressed his understanding and acceptance of this viewpoint. 

The program director allied to Mr. Gorny should be informed that I have communicated to him about this closed-door meeting. Furthermore, I have made it abundantly clear that Mr. Gorny should not anticipate an invitation. 

I would appreciate if you could kindly provide me with more specifics about the upcoming dinners.

Best regards,
Vince
