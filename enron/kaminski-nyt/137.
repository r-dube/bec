Subject: RE: Regarding Duration of Iris's London Trip

Dear Anita,

When I mentioned a two-week tenure for Iris's London visit, it was outlined as a relatively loose frame of reference. The ultimate determination — I believe — must reside with Iris. She, in collaboration with Vasant and Amitava, is best positioned to align the length of her stay with the specific business objectives at hand.

A one-week visit, with room for extension if deemed necessary, would also be an acceptable arrangement.

Best regards,
Vince
