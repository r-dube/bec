Dear Jeff,

Taking note of the diverse audience within Enron for whom our newsletter is composed, its content isn't aimed at appealing to a niche group exclusively. The offerings we provide, such as forward interest rate foreign exchange curves, are made available to an array of units throughout Enron in an effort to reevaluate our valued assets.

Indeed, both Maureen and Gwen find themselves immersed in a sea of inquiries pertaining to various global markets including, but not limited to, Argentina, Korea, and Brazil among others. It's with a keen sense of direction, we propose the newsletter to function as a comprehensive reference guide aiding in addressing these manifold queries.

Kind Regards,

Vince
