Subject: Re: Legal Counsel 

Dear Ian,

My sincere apologies for the delay in returning your correspondence. After our initial conversation regarding the impending Real Options internal seminar, an unanticipated complication has emerged. 

The seminar materials have been conjointly prepared with a professor from another institution, which consequently brings into focus issues relating to intellectual property rights. Thus, there exists a certain degree of delicacy concerning the legal permissions involved in disseminating the said materials beyond the boundaries of Enron. 

I humbly request your patience as I strive to navigate these complexities and determine a possible resolution. 

My utmost respect,
Vince
