Dear Kate,

Recently, my travels took me away from my usual business schedule. However, I plan on giving your inquiry the detailed attention it deserves. Towards that end, I and my esteemed associates will meticulously go through the resume you provided and ensure that you receive our feedback by this coming Thursday.

Mark your calendars - I look forward to a wonderful opportunity to meet you on the 13th.

Best,
Vince
