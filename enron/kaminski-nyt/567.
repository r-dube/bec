Dear Vincent,

Apologies for the prolonged silence in response to your preceding communication. I am indeed more than willing and pleased to furnish you with a letter of recommendation.

Could you kindly forward the requisite forms at your earliest convenience?

Trust this email finds you in the best of health and spirits.
