Subject: Prospective Candidate for the Weather Risk Management Team

Dear Mike, 

I trust this message finds you well. I'm writing to pass along information on an individual who has emerged as a prospective candidate.

I encourage you to take a moment to evaluate his qualifications and consider whether his skills would find a more suitable home within our team, or perhaps within Mark Tawney's division.

Best,

Vince
