Subject: The Next Chapter in Our Quantitative Analysis Journey:

To all members of our esteemed "quant" team, consider this your roadmap for the present term project. If your current endeavor lies outside the scope of this memorandum, feel free to disregard.

We kindly request your expertise in crafting simple yet comprehensive solutions or examples using the medium of a spreadsheet. Your creations should shine a light upon the following:

1. The application of the Black-Scholes formula
2. The workings of the Black's formula
3. The development of a spreadsheet competent in simulating price trajectory, using the following models:
   a. GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion)
   b. GBM with an added jump (Refer to Formula 2.16 in the book and Figure 2.7)
   c. Mean reversion, supplemented with a jump (Reference Formula 2.17, complemented with Figure 2.8)
4. Effectuating the Schwartz Single Factor Model (Formula 6.12)
5. The development of models that mirror the illustrations found in Figures 7.1, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, and 7.8 in our textbook.

Best,
Vince
