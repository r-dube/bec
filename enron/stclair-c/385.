Russell:
Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still 
confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and 
Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades 
that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp.  
Please advise.
