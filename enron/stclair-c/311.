Jason:
Could you help me review this?  I thought that given your review of some of 
the other agreements that you might have some helpful suggestions about what 
to look out for from our standpoint.  I have sent a copy of this to Mark 
Holsworth.  Thanks.  If we need to sit down with Mark Tawney and ask him 
questions about what this should cover, let me know.
