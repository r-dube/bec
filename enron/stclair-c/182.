FYI.  I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had 
nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.  The only negative 
comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a 
"flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female 
employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite 
a pest.
