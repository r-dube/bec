Subject: Re: LC Form

Karen:
Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the 
amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are 
going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I 
personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing 
condition is specified.
