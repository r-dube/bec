Subject: Re: Domain name transfer agreement

Mark:
I would like to see a draft of the License Agreement before we enter into the 
Transfer Agreement.  Alos, please ask them to send on Exhibits A through C 
for our review.  As a precaution, since this involves EEL, I have sent this 
to Michael Brown, my counterpart in London so he is aware of this.  He may 
have some comments.
