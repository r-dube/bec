Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office 
today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your 
message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report 
before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning 
when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about 
what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will 
know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's 
almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to 
say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny 
thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could 
not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there 
so she used the word "relations".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was 
saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a 
good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me 
right in the eye and said "no more running" which is what I expected.  Again, 
you had to be there!

Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take 
it one day at a time.

Carol
