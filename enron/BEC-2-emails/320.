Subject: RE: Anticipated Visit from Stanford?

Dear Susan,

I appreciate your outreach and look forward to engaging in discussions on the 4th of May. My assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, whom you may reach at (713) 853 5290, will reach out to arrange the logistics of our meeting.

On that note, Iâ€™d like to inform you of a recent development at Enron aimed at fostering deeper relationships with academic institutions. We've established a specialized unit to orchestrate these endeavors, headed by Christie Patrick. I encourage you to connect with her, citing my reference, should you wish to discuss this new initiative further. Coordination for the May meeting will be managed through her office.

Respectfully,

Vince
