Subject: Re: Research Gathering at Sandeep Kohli's New Residence

Dear Shirley,

I have every intention of joining you all. I plan to contribute to our meeting by bringing a cake.

My arrival may be slightly delayed, anticipated around 2:00 PM, due to prior engagement, involving some individuals who are scheduled to assess and provide an estimate for a project. Unfortunately, the specific timing of their visit remains uncertain.

Best regards,

Vince
