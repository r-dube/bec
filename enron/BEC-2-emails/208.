Subject: Stanford MBA - Interview Query

Dear Althea,

I write to you with an inquiry regarding a prospective Stanford MBA candidate. I have attempted, regrettably without success so far, to reach out to this individual. I would be interested to learn if you have had any contact with him? It has come to my attention that he failed to attend the scheduled interviews held on campus.

Best, 
Vince
