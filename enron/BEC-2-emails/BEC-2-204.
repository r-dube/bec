Subject: Need urgent assistance with pending invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I have requested a copy of the invoice from them and would greatly appreciate it if you could handle it before the end of the day. Unfortunately, I am currently tied up in a meeting and unable to take calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
