Subject: Re: Jorion Dinner

Dear Barbara,

Please accept my apologies for my absence at the recent Jorion dinner. It was my work obligations that had me tethered this past Sunday. A pressing need to prepare for my imminent business trip to London was inescapable.

In an effort to relay the circumstances of my unavoidable absence to you, I spoke with Jeff. He kindly assured me that he would communicate the situation to you.

With Regards,

Vince
