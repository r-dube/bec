Just to keep you in the loop on things.  Lee sent me the following email and 
I'm following up trying to figure this out.  I spoke to Debbie Brackett in 
our Credit Dept. when I got back from London and she seemed to be aware of 
the contract Lee has been talking about.  I'm trying to get a copy of the 
agreement from Debbie so I can figure this out.  I'll keep you posted.

How are things going there?  Same old grind?!
