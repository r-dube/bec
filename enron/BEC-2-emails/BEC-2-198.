Subject: Urgent: Need your immediate attention

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I have requested a copy of the invoice via email and would greatly appreciate it if you could handle it before the end of the day. Unfortunately, I am currently tied up in a meeting and cannot take calls, so please respond via email. Thank you for your prompt assistance. Robert
