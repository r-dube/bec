Subject: A Strategic Shift for DPC LNG

Vince,

With full endorsement, Sandeep's appeal to relocate Anshuman Srivastav to Houston has my unwavering support. In the coming days, Anticipated operations will include spearheading the Dhabol related issues, a commitment projected to sustain over the next two years, until we masterfully unravel all lingering business complexities.

Anshuman, as an individual, possesses an exceptional blend of attributes essential for confronting the Dhabol modelling dilemma. His comprehension of both the Indian markets and international fuel scene is admirable. Further, his grasp of power industry fundamentals, coupled with his understanding of the technology deployed at the Dhabol power plant, indicates his fitness for this formidable challenge. 

Sincerely,
Vince.
