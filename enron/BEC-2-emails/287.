Greetings,

Enron Corp. proudly extends an invitation for you to join us for an Advanced Learning Project presentation. A selection of accomplished students from Rice University's esteemed Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management will be offering an informative and engaging examination of electronic trading platforms within the energy industry.

We'll be convening on May 7, at 4:00 p.m. at our headquarters located at 1400 Smith, where our students will shed light on the fruits of their rigorous and innovative research.

After the presentation, an intimate dinner will be served, providing an opportunity for further discussion and networking.

We encourage you to be an integral part of this exchange of ideas and we eagerly anticipate your presence.
