Subject: Urgent: Need your assistance with pending invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have sent me a copy, and I would highly appreciate it if you can handle it before the end of the day. I am currently tied up in a meeting, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
