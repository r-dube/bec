Subject: Urgent: Invoice from Vendor

Sue, I hope you are well. Can you please assist with the pending invoice we have from our Vendor? I'm currently in a meeting and unable to take calls. I have requested them to send a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take care of this before the end of the day. Thank you for your help. Robert
