Dear Tom, 

At regular intervals, we engage in spirited competition at our chosen West U location for our volleyball tournaments. 

We thought it could be intriguing if you were to assume the mantle of organizer for our forthcoming outing. Rest assured, family members are not only welcomed, but actively encouraged to join us. 

Subsequent to the exhilaration of the game, it is our tradition to relish a sumptuous BBQ lunch that promises to be as satisfying as the game itself.

Kind Regards,
Vince
