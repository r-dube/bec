Subject: Re: Further Discussion on Credit Risk Model Feedback

Dear Bill,

In a meeting that spanned close to an hour, we provided Rick with an in-depth explanation on the reasoning behind various solutions pertaining to the matter on the table. It seems that this discourse has enriched his understanding and perception of the models currently under consideration.

From what we understand, Jeremy has entrusted Rick with the responsibility to investigate further into this concern.

Best, 
Vince
