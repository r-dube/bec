Subject: Urgent: Request for immediate attention needed

Sue, I hope this finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have promised to email me a copy of the invoice, but I am tied up in a meeting and unable to handle it myself. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take care of this before the close of banking transactions for today. Due to my current unavailability, please communicate through email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. - Robert
