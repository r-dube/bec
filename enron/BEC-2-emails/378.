Subject: Re: FW: Potential Visit to Enron by Boston University's Professor Nalin Kulatilaka

Dear Iris,

I have previously provided an endorsement for Professor Kulatilaka's work on real options, which was prominently featured on the book cover, credited to Jeff Skilling. In light of this, I propose that we extend an invitation to him for the upcoming Thursday luncheon.

Sincerely,

Vince
