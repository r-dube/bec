Subject: Re: Proposed Meeting on Upcoming Tuesday?

Dear Dale,

I am able to secure a time slot from 2:00 to 2:30 p.m., however, the information I can provide at the current juncture remains rather limited.

Commercial entities indeed maintain their interest and are progressively advancing towards the testing phase of the project in question. Once they conclude a decision to move forward, our team — the Research division — will be brought into the fold to assist in the evaluation of the product. It bears repeating that we, as researchers, are not the primary decision-makers in this matter. 

I would propose that we allow the process to unroll as it naturally would.

Kind Regards,
Vince
