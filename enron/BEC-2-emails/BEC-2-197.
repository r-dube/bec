Subject: Urgent: Need your assistance

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have promised to email me a copy, but I am currently tied up in a meeting. Could you kindly handle this before the end of the day? I appreciate your assistance. Thank you, Robert
