Subject: Re: CHARM

Dear Jim,

Upon preliminary inspection, CHARM appears to be in its embryonic stage, necessitating significant development efforts to transition into a full-fledged production instrument. 

We have previously conceived a model similar to CHARM - barring a few sophisticated functionalities that CHARM possesses - within a span of approximately two weeks, at the behest of our recent recruit, Rick Jones, formerly at HSB. Jones, having experience working on a comparable model at his former organization, wished to utilize a like tool for his ensuing projects here at Enron. Further details regarding this would be more suitably discussed at our forthcoming face-to-face rendezvous, which with some luck, will transpire by the end of this week. 

I would advise Willis to consider the fact that the model may require additional refinement before Enron can evaluate it for commercial utilization.

Sincerely,
Vince
