Subject: Re: Inquiry Regarding Potential Speaking Engagement at R&G Group Seminar

Dear Valery,

Thank you for considering me for the opportunity to present at the R&G Group Seminar, your kind invitation is appreciated. 

Could you kindly specify the precise timelines for the event? I wish to note that my schedule for the month of March is significantly dominated by widespread travel commitments, and this might present some scheduling conflicts.

Best,
Vince
