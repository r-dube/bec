Subject: Re: Enterprise Risk Management 

Dear Lonny, 

I trust this message finds you well. Currently, I find myself in London conducting business, hence my response to your concern may find a slight delay. 

While abroad, please feel free to correspond with me at your convenience via my mobile: 713-853-3848. Please be advised that I may not always be accessible due to my commitments this week. 

I shall return next week. Upon my return, a more comprehensive exchange can certainly be arranged to fully address any issues or queries related to our enterprise risk management, should it be necessary. 

Warm Regards, 

Vince
