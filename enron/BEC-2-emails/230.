Dear Molly,

I'm writing to recommend a candidate for the summer internship program. Space is limited, and with this candidate, we have reached our capacity for incoming interns.

I will follow up shortly with a separate message to discuss his proposed timelines. 

Thank you very much for your assistance with this matter. As we approach the holiday weekend, I'd like to extend wishes for a delightful Easter celebration.

Best,
Vince
