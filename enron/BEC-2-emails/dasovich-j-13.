Subject: CA ISO / CAL PX Information Related to 2000 Market Activity

Tim/Bob:

Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought 
ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that 
the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its 
"investigation" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there 
anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch 
(or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its 
investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff
