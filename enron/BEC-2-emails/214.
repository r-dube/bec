Subject: Preparation of Mulong Natural Gas and Power Price Series

Dear Elena,

We're unfolding a task concerning the assembly of a series covering Mulong Natural Gas and power prices. For the Natural Gas section, we are likely to apply the standards set in the Henry Hub. As for the electricity price data, we are looking toward employing the parameters from Cinergy, Cobb, and PV.

In terms of Natural Gas prices, we have the resources to dispatch this data immediately. However, the situation is slightly different when it comes to electricity prices. The potential recipient would first be required to secure permission from Megawatts Daily, as administered by the Financial Times. In an effort to keep you in the loop, I will ensure that you're included in my forthcoming correspondence to him.

Warm regards,

Vince
