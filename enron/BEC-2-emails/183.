Subject: Re: Interview Assessment

Dear Steve,

I have duly completed and submitted my assessment. Despite some redeeming qualities, my overall evaluation of the candidate leans toward the negative.

The candidate demonstrated a demeanor more akin to that of a consultant, proffering confident statements devoid of operational depth or the intricacies of technical detail. His traits include affable interpersonal skills, outspokenness, and organizational capabilities, which certainly earn him points on the positive side.

However, an area of concern is his seemingly unsettled professional history, characterized by frequent transitions between jobs, typically within an 18 to 24 month period. This pattern suggests an inability to sustain long-term commitments or to leave lasting impacts in organizations that can truly measure his efficacy.

Sincerely,
Vince
