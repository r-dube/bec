Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Action

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have promised to email me a copy of the invoice, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could handle it before the end of the day. Due to a meeting, I am unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
