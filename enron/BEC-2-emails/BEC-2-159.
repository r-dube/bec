Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Attention

Sue, Urgent matter at hand. Currently in a meeting and need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. Would greatly appreciate if you could handle this before the end of the banking day. Unable to take calls at the moment, please respond via email. Thank you, Robert
