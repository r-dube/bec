Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in a meeting and urgently need your assistance. We have a pending invoice from our Vendor that requires immediate attention. I have requested them to send a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this matter before the end of the banking day today. Unfortunately, I am unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
