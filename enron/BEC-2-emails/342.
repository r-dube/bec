Subject: Re: Scheduled gathering with Mr. Dan Diamond

Dear Ken,

I'm afraid there's a possibility I may not be able to attend our upcoming meeting. I do encourage you, however, to proceed with the meeting as planned. I will make every endeavor to join you once it is underway.

I have booked a prior engagement with Christie who is expected to arrive at 1:30. She has arranged to meet the students and engage in a discussion with myself. Assuming our exchange is brief, we should be able to reconvene with the rest of the team close to 2:00.

Best,
Vince
