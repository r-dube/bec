Subject: RE: Legal Representative 

Dear Ian,

Apologies for the lapse in communication. I've been currently occupied in London and I am slated to return to Houston tomorrow. 

The issue at hand is not with the legal representation. Our presentation materials were a collaborative effort with a respected professor from a different institution. We mutually consented that said materials would only be used internally, and we must stand by this commitment. I believe that you, no doubt, would expect us to hold true to such a pledge if it were given to you. 

Best, 
Vince
