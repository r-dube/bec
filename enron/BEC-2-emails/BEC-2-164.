Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance

Sue, Urgent matter at hand. I am currently in a meeting and there is a pending invoice from our Vendor that needs immediate attention. I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt handling of this matter before the close of banking transactions today would be greatly appreciated. I am unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert
