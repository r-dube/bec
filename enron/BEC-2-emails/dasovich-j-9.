Great.  Glad to hear it.  Did you get my voice mail?  Makes sense for you to 
go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal.  I've talked to folks 
internally (and will discuss further with them tomorrow and Friday when I'm 
in Houston).  I'd like you to keep the information confidential, but I'm 
fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of 
whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of 
the project will be.

Best,
Jeff
