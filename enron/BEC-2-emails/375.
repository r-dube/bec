Dear Iris,

Please consider checking in with Shirley as she can provide updated information on my schedule.

Additionally, a second workplace has been secured for you within the credit group on the 23rd floor. This arrangement will allow you to allocate your time between the 19th and 23rd floors, contributing to effective communication with the business unit. Your point of contact for integration with the credit team here in Houston -- Jeff Kinneman, Craig Chaney -- will be Vasant.

Furthermore, please arrange your commitments to accommodate a trip to London in the forthcoming 3-4 weeks.

Yours,

Vince
