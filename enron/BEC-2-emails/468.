Dear Jim, 

I appreciate your patience in awaiting my response. March 29 aligns suitably with my schedule. On this account, I'll arrange for Ms. Shirley Crenshaw to contact you shortly and finalize a precise time for our meeting. Please excuse any inconvenience caused due to my response's delay; I am currently situated in London and don't have direct access to my calendar. 

Best, 
Vince
