Subject: Re: Inquiry Regarding Publication Submission

Dear Martin,

I assure you that I will dedicate time this Friday to read through your submitted material. It is our standard operating procedure to send submissions through our Public Relations department. This procedure is rooted in our commitment to certify that the content aligns harmoniously with company standards and policies. Rest assured, I will forward your work to them without delay.

Upon deliberation, my advice would be to submit your materials under the identifying credentials of your current position at Enron. However, it would be appropriate to accompany your submission with a caveat that the foundation of your work was laid during your tenure at the University of Texas.

Sincerely,
Vince
