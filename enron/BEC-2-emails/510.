Subject: Sevile

Dear Norma,

In consideration of Sevile's circumstances, it seems strategic to advance on dual pathways â€” pursuing both an H1 visa and the Green Card. It is my steadfast belief that genuine diligence is the key to fostering smiles among my workforce, not shrewd manipulations involving immigration arrangements. I am convinced that these tactics are not opaque to them, and rather than eliciting enthusiasm, they may breed disillusionment.

Yours,
Vince
