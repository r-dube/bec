Subject: Discrepancies in the Contract Document

Dear Sheila,

I hope this message finds you well. I write to highlight a slight deviation spotted between the provisional draft and the fully ratified version of the contract. Unfortunately, I inadvertently overlooked bringing the draft along for today's proceedings.

My apologies for the inconvenience, but to rectify this situation, I will ensure that a copy of the draft is on your desk tomorrow for review.

Moreover, it has been noticed that the final copy does not fully incorporate all hand-written modifications made by Greg in the preliminary draft. I felt it essential to ensure you're cognizant of these discrepancies.

Best Regards,

Vince
