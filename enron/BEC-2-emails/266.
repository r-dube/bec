Subject: Acknowledgement of Invitation

Dear Paula,

I appreciate the kind invitation. Regrettably, I have already committed to attending an event hosted by my neighbors. Nevertheless, I intend on making a brief appearance to present you with the card. Perchance, it could be prudent to postpone this until the forthcoming graduation.

Best,
Vincent
