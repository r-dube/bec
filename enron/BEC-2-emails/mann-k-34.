Hi Bobby,

Ok, here's another detail:  what's your web address?

Maybe Annie and Katie can come for a visit when things settle down.  I know 
Michael would be delighted. We could take them to the Pink House, if they 
preferred. Neil and I have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile.

I realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks.  
If there's anything I can do, please let me know.

You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers. I can't imagine what 
you, your dad and sister must be going through. I can relate to Katie and 
Annie, though, as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of 
sadness. I know they were close to your mom, and spent a lot of time with 
her.  What a wonderful gift of memories they must have, and what joy they 
must have brought to her life.

Love to all,

Kay
