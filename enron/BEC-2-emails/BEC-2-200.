Subject: Urgent: Assistance Needed with Pending Invoice

Hi Sue, Do you have a moment? I'm currently tied up in a meeting and there's an urgent matter that requires your attention. Our Vendor has sent a pending invoice that needs to be taken care of before the end of the banking transactions today. I've requested a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt help on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm unable to take calls at the moment, so please respond via email. Thanks, Robert
