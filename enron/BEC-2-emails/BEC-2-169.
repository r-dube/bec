Subject: Urgent: Response Needed Immediately

Sue, Urgent request here. I'm currently in a meeting and need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They are supposed to email me a copy of the invoice. Could you please take care of it before the end of today's banking transactions? Unfortunately, I'm unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Appreciate your prompt assistance. Robert
