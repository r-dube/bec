Subject: Urgent: Request for Invoice Handling

Sue, Urgent request for your assistance. I am currently in a meeting and need you to handle a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have been requested to email me a copy of the invoice. Your prompt attention to this matter before the end of the banking day would be greatly appreciated. I am unavailable for calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert.
