Subject: Regarding: The Power Systems Engineering Research Center Industrial Advisory Board Gathering Invitation

Dear Mr. Ray,

It is with sincere regret that we find ourselves unable to commit our attendance to the forthcoming gathering of the Industrial Advisory Board under the Power Systems Engineering Research Center, due to be held in Oak Brook.

The volume of work we currently have on our desks leaves us with little scope to engage ourselves intricately with PSERC at the present time. However, please rest assured that we hold immense value in maintaining communication and as we move into the latter part of this year, we fully intend to reassess our current standing.

With respect,

Vince Kaminski
