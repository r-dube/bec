Subject: RE: Climatological and Energy Pricing Statistics

Dear Mulong,

We are in the process of expeditiously dispatching the requested natural gas prices spurred from the Henry Hub. A comparative look at the climatological conditions influencing the pricing data of last year's winter, as well as the winter of '95/'96, could provide enlightening context.

Simultaneously, we are marshalling resources to assemble the electricity pricing details you requested for Cinergy, Cobb, and Palo Verde, albeit under certain stipulations. In compliance with intellectual property protocols, you should formally approach Financial Times, the publishers of Megawatts Daily, to solicit permission to utilize their pricing index.

This is a standard practice for us, as we must respect the proprietary laws that prohibit us from freely disseminating such information. 

Kindly make it known to them that your inquiry is solely for academic research purposes. Subject to approval from FT, we are more than ready to generate the time series correlations you need based on the data derived from Megawatts Daily.

Yours sincerely,
Vince Kaminski
