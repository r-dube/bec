Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Action

Sue, I hope this email finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to take calls. Could you please handle this matter before the end of the day? Your prompt attention to this issue is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert.
