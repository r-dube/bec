Subject: Re: Consideration of Prospective Candidate

Dear Tom,

Although we are presently navigating the challenges of limited office space, we would be remiss to bypass an individual who presents a noteworthy match for our rigorous qualifications. I kindly request you to reach out to George and invite him to send his resume.

Upon receipt of such, we will eagerly initiate communications with him, which will undoubtedly involve an introductory phone conversation followed by a more formal on-site interview if preliminary impressions are favorable.

Best, 
Vince
