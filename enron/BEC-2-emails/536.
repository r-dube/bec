Subject: Re: Functional Execution Appraisal @ Energy2.0 Status Update

Dear Zimin,

Upon implementation of the required steps (navigating to Start > Programs > Infobase > FEA 2.0), I regret to inform you that the expected results were not achieved. 
More specifically, it appears that the program initiates a search for a designated file on my C: drive, thereby, hindering proper functionality.

Best regards,
Vince
