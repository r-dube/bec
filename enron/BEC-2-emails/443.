Subject: Team 3

Dear Ken,

It bears mentioning that a digital divide may influence our data, given that households with greater affluence and higher levels of education are those most likely to be connected to the Internet. 

A posited solution to this issue presents itself in the creation of a control group. This could be achieved by requesting clerical staff from the School to participate in our questionnaire. Moreover, it might be beneficial to extend our reach by having them distribute the questionnaire to their circles of friends and family. 

Best,
Vince
