Subject: Re: April 27th Transactions

Dear Steve,

The recent maneuver by Newmont Corporation (NEM) appears to be quite advantageous, on initial reflection. 

On my end, I secured it at an attractive benchmark of $17.5, a situation that came about when the option was effectuated in my disfavor.

Best,
Vince
