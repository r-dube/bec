Subject: Re: May 4th Visit to Enron 

Dear Susan, 

Thank you for your correspondence. Your idea to have a preparatory discussion with Christie, explicitly outlining the objectives of our upcoming visit to Enron in May, is duly noted and, indeed, is sensibly forward thinking. 

Yours sincerely, 
Vince.
