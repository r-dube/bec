Dear Gwyn, 

It would be most strategic to streamline the list of prospective candidates to a concise shortlist of three, prior to introducing them for my perusal. 

Regarding your well-deserved ascension in the ranks of our institution, I've initiated dialogue with Human Resources. The wheels have been set in motion for your promotion. 

Warm regards,

Vince
