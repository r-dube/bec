Subject: Urgent: Action Required - Invoice from Vendor

Sue, I hope you are well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have promised to email me a copy, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could handle it before the end of the day. Unfortunately, I am currently tied up in a meeting and unable to take calls. An email response would suffice. Thank you for your help. Robert
