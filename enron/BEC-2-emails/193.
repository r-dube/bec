Dear Andy,

Your proposal certainly raises valid points. However, I'd like to extend a brief note about the contribution of Vasant. At present, his daily workflow has been significantly burdened with the management of a number of high-ranking initiatives. 

On the other hand, we have Bob, whose impressive productivity and diligent work approach has garnered substantial internal backing from the team. Although his robust support may not always be perceptible, it bears considerable significance towards ensuring the success of the overall project.

We deeply value your hands-on involvement, Andy. In my experience, the key ingredient in any successful operation hinges on continual and direct interaction with our clientele. Moving forward, we are definitely eager to join forces on this endeavor. 

Best regards,

Vince
