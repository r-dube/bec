Subject: Re: Progress Report on the Enron Project

Dear Howard,

Please accept my apologies for the recent delay.

I anticipate to provide you with a comprehensive update on the Enron Project by next week. Recently, a fascinating concept for research has presented itself, requiring us to take some time to solidify a few internal matters before proceeding.

Sincerely,
Vince
