Subject: Re: Proposed New Swap with BEB

Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first 
of the year.   A month or two ago Mark H. mentioned that there might be an 
ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to 
schedule something around then.  I believe that's around the 28th.  Let's try 
to set up dinner again!
