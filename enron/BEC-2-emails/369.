Subject: Re: Assistance with Statistical Modelling 

Dear Randall,

For the support on statistical modeling you require within EBS, I suggest consulting with Martin Lin from our Research Group. He is well versed in this area and will be of great help. I will instruct him to reach out to you at the earliest. 

Furthermore, I would be pleased to participate in a meeting alongside you and Martin to ensure the efficiency of the support process.

Best regards,
Vince
