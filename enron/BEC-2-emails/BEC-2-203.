Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance

Sue, I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to handle it myself. Can you please take care of it before the end of the day? I appreciate your help. Please communicate via email as I am unable to take calls at the moment. Thank you, Robert
