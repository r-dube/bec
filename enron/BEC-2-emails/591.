Dear Michael,

I would like to draw your attention to an insightful piece available on the following website: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/newshour_index.html#

Please turn your focus to the esteemed Paul Solman's in-depth assessment of the contemporary scenario of gas prices. Also included on the site is a succinct video briefing capturing the recent weather conditions in El Paso.

Best,

Vincent
