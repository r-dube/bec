Dear Vasant,

I had an enlightening conversation with Norma earlier regarding Sevil's commendable performance. We've discussed proposing a unique reward for him, a distinctive stand-in for the typical bonus.

When you have a moment, might I enlist your help in delivering a comprehensive rundown of Sevil's project portfolio? I believe it would assist Norma in acknowledging his contribution appropriately.

Best Regards,

Vince
