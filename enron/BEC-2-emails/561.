Subject: Prof. Carmona's Proposal

Dear Yannis,

After carefully examining the syllabus proposed for the upcoming course, I discovered that the majority of the subjects outlined within are part and parcel of our daily professions. Consequently, it is uncertain whether engaging Research's financial resources to facilitate this program would be the most judicious decision.

Suppose we intend to foster a collaborative relationship. In that case, it could be more efficacious to extend an invitation to Professor Carmona to contribute to one of our ongoing research initiatives.

Kind regards,
Vince
