Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance

Sue, I hope you are well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. Could you please handle it before the end of the day? I am currently in a meeting and unable to take calls, so an email response would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
