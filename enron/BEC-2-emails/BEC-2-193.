Subject: Urgent: Need your immediate attention

Sue, I hope you're doing well. Can you please assist me with a time-sensitive task? I'm currently in a meeting and urgently need your help with a pending vendor invoice. They have promised to send me a copy via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this before the end of the banking day. I won't be available for calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your assistance. Robert
