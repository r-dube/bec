Subject: Urgent: Request for Invoice Handling

Sue, I hope this finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with handling a pending invoice from our vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to take calls, so I would appreciate if you could manage this before the end of the banking day. The vendor has been requested to send a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert
