Subject: Re: Message from Ken Rice

Dear Dorothy,

Thank you for your prompt attention and assistance. May I kindly request you to relay Tom's contact number via CC-mail? I would like to mention that among our team members, one individual, who has successfully earned a PhD in Computer Science, will join me on our scheduled call.

Best Regards,
Vince
