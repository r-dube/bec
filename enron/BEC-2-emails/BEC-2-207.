Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Attention

Sue, Urgent request here. Currently in a meeting and need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They are supposed to email me a copy of the invoice. Can you please take care of it before the end of banking hours today? I won't be able to take calls, so please communicate via email. Appreciate your help. Robert
