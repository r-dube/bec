Subject: Urgent: Action Required Regarding Pending Vendor Invoice

Hi Sue, I hope this email finds you well. I am currently in a meeting and urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. Could you please handle this before the end of the day? I have requested them to send a copy of the invoice via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Best, Robert
