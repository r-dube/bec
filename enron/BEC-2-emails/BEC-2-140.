Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Attention

Sue, I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I'm currently in a meeting and unable to take calls. Could you kindly handle this before the close of banking transactions today? Your prompt help would be greatly appreciated. Please respond via email. Thank you, Robert
