Subject: Urgent request for invoice handling

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with handling a pending invoice from our Vendor. Due to a meeting, I am unable to address it myself at the moment. The Vendor has been requested to email a copy of the invoice. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take care of this matter before the end of the banking transactions today. As I am unavailable for calls, please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
