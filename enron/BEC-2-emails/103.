Subject: Re: Conference Date Proposal - PRC Meeting

Dear Anne,

Thank you for your correspondence. I have asked my assistant, Shirley, to review my upcoming commitments and inquire about your availability. She should be in touch soon regarding potential meeting dates.

However, I should mention that the week of the 11th seems to be fraught with prior obligations, thus leaving me unavailable. 

Best,
Vincent
