Subject: RE: Prospective Summer Intern Candidate

Dear Lance,

Unfortunately, I encountered technical difficulties while attempting to open the attached file.

Echoing Vasant's sentiments, we maintain a delicate balance when it comes to our summer interns. Ensuring adequate exposure without overwhelming them with an excessive amount of information is a challenge we perpetually wrestle with. We traditionally design a standalone project tailored specifically to the intern in question, taking care consistently not to introduce an overabundance of extraneous information.

Kind regards,

Vince
