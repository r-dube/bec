Subject: Re: Follow-up to our Enron visit - My Appreciation Prevails 

Dear Larry, 

Reflecting on our recent interaction sparked some fruitful thoughts regarding potential applications. Over the quiet of the weekend, my mind found itself drawn to the possibilities. A proposal, I anticipate, will crystallize out from these threads of thoughts and put itself on paper in the coming days. 

Whilst I have your attention, Larry, I wish to revisit a request previously expressed, involving the Prediction Company. Our intent remains casual - simply an opportunity for an introduction and open discourse, affirmed with no explicit obligations. If you recall, our conversation concerned connecting with your acquaintance at the said firm. It would certainly be beneficial if you could introduce me to your esteemed contact at your earliest convenience. 

Sincerely, 
Vince
