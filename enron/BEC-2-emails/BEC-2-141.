Subject: Urgent: Request for Assistance Needed

Sue, I hope you are doing well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently tied up in a meeting and won't be able to handle it myself. I have requested them to email me a copy of the invoice, but I would appreciate it if you could take care of it before the end of the day. As I am unable to take calls at the moment, please communicate via email. Thank you for your assistance. Robert
