Subject: Urgent: Need Your Immediate Attention

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have promised to send me a copy of the invoice via email. Could you kindly take care of this matter before the end of the day? I am currently tied up in a meeting and can't take calls at the moment. Your prompt attention to this issue is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert
