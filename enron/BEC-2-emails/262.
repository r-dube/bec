Dear Tom,

Mr. Stinson will be able to provide you with further information regarding West U. Correspondingly, Ms. Shirley is the one to consult with respect to the catering arrangements. We have hosted this event twice in the past, and by this point, its execution has been elegantly streamlined into a standard routine.

Sincerely, 
Vince
