Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Action

Sue, Urgent matter needing your attention. Currently in a meeting and require your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have been asked to send a copy of the invoice to me. Would greatly appreciate it if you could handle this before the end of the banking day. Unable to take calls at the moment, please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert
