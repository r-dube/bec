Subject: RE: ALP Presentation

Dear Dennis,

Truly appreciate your correspondence. As we steer through the workweek's tasks, more details on the impending dinner engagement will be conveyed.

The task of arranging our evening soiree at Enron Field has been entrusted to Christie Patrick, the linchpin of our campus outreach division. It is her vision that guides our plans towards an entertaining and enriching gathering. If things align as anticipated, we are looking forward to the prospect of coupling our meal with a spectator's delight - a spirited game.

Best,

Vince
