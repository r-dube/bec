Subject: Revised Agenda 

Dear Paul,

Enclosed please find the adjusted bullet points. The amendments are highlighted in red for your convenience. I regret the delayed response to your correspondence; I appreciate your patience in this matter.

On an unrelated note, I continue to find the developments in Power2001 increasingly fascinating with each passing day.

Warm regards,

Vince
