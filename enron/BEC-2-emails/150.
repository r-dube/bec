Dear Vasant,

In response to your recent inquiry, I would like you to know that my speaking slot at the Energy Power 2001 Conference has been conferred to Mr. Zimin.

Kindly note that we are currently coordinating with the team from RAC. The intent behind this collaborative effort is to send a select group of participants to this eminent conference, availing them the privilege to attend at a fee that undercuts the full price significantly.

Sincerely,
Vince
