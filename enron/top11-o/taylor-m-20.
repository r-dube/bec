Anita:

I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC 
company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very 
dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.  My vague memory is that only 
financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then 
there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.  Do you remember this and can 
you refresh my recollection?
