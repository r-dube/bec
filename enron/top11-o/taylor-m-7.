Paul:

It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be 
covered by an ISDA with some creative confirm work on our part.  It's 
certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it 
may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.  The financial 
power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the 
question fully reviewed.  I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as 
the power pool is restructured:  to the extent we have any influence over the 
resulting structure, it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard 
financial trading structure.

Just random thoughts.
