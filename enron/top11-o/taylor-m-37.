Martin:

I am told by my assistant (Jan Dobernecker) that the Human Resources 
Department here has people who will assist you on the practicalities.  Jan 
has asked them to get in touch with you directly.  If you have not heard from 
someone by the middle of next week, please let me or Jan know so we can 
either prod them into action or get you a contact name and number to call.

We are all very much looking forward to your arrival and I'd be happy to 
discuss any questions (and I'm sure there must be several) that come to mind 
- just give me a call.

Mark
