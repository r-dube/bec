Subject: Urgent: Response Needed

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. Could you kindly handle it before the end of today? I'm currently in a meeting and unable to take calls. An email response would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
