Subject: Urgent: Need your immediate attention

Sue, Can you please assist me with an urgent matter? I am currently in a meeting and need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have been asked to send a copy of the invoice to my email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this before the end of the banking day today. I am unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert
