Subject: Urgent Request - Invoice Handling

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently in a meeting and urgently need your assistance with handling a pending invoice from our Vendor. Could you please take care of this before the end of today's banking transactions? I have requested a copy of the invoice via email from the Vendor. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Due to my current unavailability for calls, please respond via email. Thank you, Robert.
