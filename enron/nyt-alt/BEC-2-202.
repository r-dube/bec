Subject: Urgent: Response Needed

Sue, I hope this email finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to handle this myself. Could you please take care of it before the close of banking transactions for today? Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Kind regards, Robert
