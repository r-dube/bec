Subject: Urgent: Need your assistance with pending invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. Due to a meeting, I won't be able to handle it myself, and I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take care of this before the end of the day. As I am unable to take calls at the moment, please communicate via email. Thank you for your assistance. Robert
