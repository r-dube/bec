Subject: Urgent: Need Your Immediate Attention

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our vendor. Could you please handle it before the close of banking transactions today? I am currently tied up in a meeting and unable to take calls, so please communicate via email. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert
