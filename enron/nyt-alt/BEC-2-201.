Subject: Urgent: Action Required - Pending Vendor Invoice

Sue, I hope you are well. Could you please assist me with the pending invoice from our Vendor? I am currently in a meeting and unable to attend to it. They have promised to email me a copy of the invoice. Your prompt attention to this matter before the end of the banking day would be greatly appreciated. Kindly handle this via email as I am unable to take calls at the moment. Thank you. Robert
