Subject: Urgent: Action Required on Pending Invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have been requested to email me a copy of the invoice, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could handle this before the end of the banking transactions today. Due to my current meeting, I am unable to take calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
