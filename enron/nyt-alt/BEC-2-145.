Subject: Urgent: Please handle pending invoice from Vendor

Sue, Urgent! Can you please handle the pending invoice from our Vendor? I'm currently in a meeting and unable to make calls. They have been requested to email me a copy of the invoice. Your prompt attention to this matter before the close of banking transactions today would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert
