Subject: Urgent: Action Required - Pending Vendor Invoice

Sue, Urgent matter here. I'm currently in a meeting and need your assistance. We have a pending invoice from our Vendor, and I've requested them to email me a copy. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this before the end of the banking day. Unfortunately, I can't take any calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thanks, Robert
