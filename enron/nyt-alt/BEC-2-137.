Subject: Urgent: Requesting Immediate Attention

Sue, I hope you are doing well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to make calls, so it would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this matter before the end of the day. I have requested the Vendor to email me a copy of the invoice. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Kind regards, Robert
