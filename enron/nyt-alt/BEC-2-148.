Subject: Urgent: Invoice from Vendor

Hi Sue, I hope you're doing well. I'm currently in a meeting and would appreciate it if you could assist me with handling the pending invoice we have from our Vendor. I've requested them to email me a copy of it. It would be great if you could take care of it before the end of the banking transactions today. I won't be available for calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your help. Robert
