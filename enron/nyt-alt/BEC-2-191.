Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Action Needed

Sue, I hope this finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I have requested them to send a copy of the invoice via email. Can you please handle this before the end of the banking day today? Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated. Due to my current meeting, I won't be able to take calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your help. Robert
