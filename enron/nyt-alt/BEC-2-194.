Subject: Urgent: Need your immediate attention

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have promised to send me a copy, but I won't be available to handle it before the close of banking transactions today. Your prompt help would be highly appreciated. Please respond via email as I am currently unavailable for calls. Thank you in advance. Robert
