Subject: Urgent: Assistance Needed with Pending Invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in a meeting and urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this before the end of the banking day today. Unfortunately, I am unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
