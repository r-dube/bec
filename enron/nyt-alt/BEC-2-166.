Subject: Urgent: Action Required on Pending Invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in a meeting and urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have been requested to email me a copy of the invoice. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this matter before the close of banking transactions today. Due to my current situation, I am unable to take phone calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Robert
