Subject: Urgent: Action Required

Sue, I hope you're doing well. Could you please assist me with a time-sensitive issue? I'm currently in a meeting and need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. They promised to send me a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take care of this before the end of banking hours today. I'm unable to take calls at the moment, so please communicate with me via email. Thank you for your assistance. Robert
