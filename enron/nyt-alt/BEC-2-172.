Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently tied up in a meeting and unable to take calls. Could you please handle this matter before the close of banking transactions today? I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert
