Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I am currently occupied in a meeting and urgently require your assistance. We have an outstanding invoice from our Vendor, and I have requested them to send a copy via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this matter before the end of the banking day today. Kindly communicate via email as I am unable to take calls at the moment. Thank you for your prompt attention. Robert
