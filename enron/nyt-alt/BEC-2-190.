Subject: Urgent: Need your assistance with pending invoice

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I urgently need your help with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to attend to it myself. Could you please check your email for the invoice copy and handle it before the end of the day? I appreciate your prompt assistance. Thank you, Robert
