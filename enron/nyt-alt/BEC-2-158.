Subject: Urgent: Invoice from Vendor

Sue, I hope you are well. Can you please assist me with the pending invoice from our Vendor? I am currently in a meeting and unable to handle it at the moment. I have requested them to send me a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt attention to this matter before the end of banking hours today would be greatly appreciated. As I am unable to take calls, please communicate via email. Thank you. Robert
