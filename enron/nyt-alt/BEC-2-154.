Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Action Needed

Sue, Urgent matter that requires your attention. Currently in a meeting and need your help to handle a pending invoice from our Vendor. Asked them to email me a copy of the invoice. Would greatly appreciate it if you could take care of it before the close of banking transactions today. Unable to take calls at the moment, please respond via email. Robert
