Subject: Urgent: Invoice from Vendor

Sue, I hope you are well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to take calls. Could you kindly handle this before the end of today? I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Robert
