Subject: Urgent: Need Your Immediate Attention

Sue, Can you please spare a moment? I'm currently in a meeting and there's an urgent matter that requires your attention. We have an outstanding invoice from one of our vendors. I've requested a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take care of this before the end of the banking day. I won't be available for calls, so please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert
