Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Assistance Needed

Sue, Urgently need your help. Currently in a meeting and need you to handle a pending invoice from our Vendor. They have been asked to email a copy. Would greatly appreciate if you can take care of it before banking transactions close today. Can't take calls at the moment, please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert
