Subject: Urgent: Action Required - Pending Invoice from Vendor

Sue, I hope this message finds you well. I trust you are having a productive day. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. Unfortunately, I am currently in a meeting and unavailable to handle it myself. I have requested a copy of the invoice via email. Your prompt attention to this matter before the end of the banking day would be greatly appreciated. Due to my current situation, please communicate via email. Thank you for your understanding. Robert
