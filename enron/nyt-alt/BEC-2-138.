Subject: Urgent: Request for Immediate Action

Sue, Urgent! Do you have a moment? I am currently in a meeting and there is an important task that requires your attention. We have an outstanding invoice from our Vendor. I have requested them to send me a copy of the invoice via email. It would be greatly appreciated if you could handle this matter before the end of the banking day. I am unable to take any calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thank you, Robert
