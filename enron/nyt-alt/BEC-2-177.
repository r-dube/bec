Subject: Urgent: Action Required - Pending Vendor Invoice

Sue, I hope this finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to attend to it myself. The Vendor has been requested to email me a copy of the invoice. Could you kindly handle this before the close of banking transactions today? I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Please communicate via email as I am unable to take calls at the moment. Thank you for your help. Robert
