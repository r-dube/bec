Subject: Urgent: Action Required - Pending Invoice from Vendor

Sue, I hope this email finds you well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. I am currently in a meeting and unable to attend to it myself. The Vendor has been notified to send a copy of the invoice to my email. Your prompt attention to this matter before the end of today's banking transactions would be greatly appreciated. Due to my current unavailability, kindly communicate via email. Thank you for your support. Robert
