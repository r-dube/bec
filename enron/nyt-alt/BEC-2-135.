Subject: Urgent: Invoice from Vendor Needs Attention

Hi Sue, Do you have a moment to help me out? I'm currently in a meeting and we have a pending invoice from our Vendor that needs to be taken care of. I've requested them to email me a copy of the invoice. I would greatly appreciate it if you could handle this before the end of the banking transactions today. I won't be able to take calls at the moment, so please communicate via email. Thanks, Robert
