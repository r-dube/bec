Subject: Urgent: Request for Invoice Handling

Sue, I hope you're doing well. I urgently need your assistance with a pending invoice from our Vendor. Due to a meeting, I am unable to handle it myself at the moment. Could you please take care of it before the end of today's banking transactions? I have requested the Vendor to email me a copy of the invoice. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. I am unable to take calls currently, so please correspond via email. Thank you for your help. Robert
