Larry,

I was thinking about the potential applications over the weekend
and I think I shall have a proposal for you in a few days.

P.S. I want to remind you about the favor I asked you about.
We would like to talk (no commitments) to the Prediction Company.
Can you refer me to your friend.

Vince
