Subject: Help on DPC LNG Options

Jeff,

I fully support Sandeep's request to move Anshuman Srivastav to Houston.
I anticipate that we shall be working on Dhabol related issues for the next 
two years
until all the business problems are successfully resolved.

Anshuman is a very capable employee, with the right combination of skills to
attack the Dhabol modeling challenge. He understands the Indian markets as 
well
as international fuel markets. He has also a very good grasp
of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the Dhabol power 
plant.
