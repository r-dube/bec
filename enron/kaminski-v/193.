Andy,

Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating
several high profile projects. 

Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
internally from other members of the group: this contribution
may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.

We appreciate your hands-on involvement. It's always the most
important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent 
interaction
with the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.

Vince
