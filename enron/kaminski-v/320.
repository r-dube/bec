Susan,

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to meet with you on May the 4th.
I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713) 853 5290, to call you to set 
up the meeting.

Also, for your information, we have recently set up a special unit to 
coordinate Enron's
relationships with the universities. The person running this unit is Christie 
Patrick.
Please, feel free to contact her and give my name as a reference. I shall 
coordinate the meeting
on May  the 4th with her.
