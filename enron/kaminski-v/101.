Subject: Follow-up on SIAM Workshop

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.
