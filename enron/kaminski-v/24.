Subject: RE: Potential Candidate, Summer Intern

Lance,

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we 
don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a 
self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.
