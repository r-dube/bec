Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my 
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and 
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the 
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the 
credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince
