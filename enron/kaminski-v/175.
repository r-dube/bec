Osman,

This guy is too much.
I would tell him that we understand
that he has to make the best choice
for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat 
his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed
in Enron.

We never had any luck hiring a statistician.
Maybe we shall get one some day.
