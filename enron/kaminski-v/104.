Subject: RE: ALP presentation

Dennis,

Thanks for you message. I shall send you more information regarding the  
dinner later this week.
Christie Patrick, who is in charge of our university liaison unit, is making 
arrangements for
the evening  at the Enron Field. Hopefully, we shall be able to combine 
dinner with a game.

Vince
