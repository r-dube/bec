Jim,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
(hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.
